# muxViz v3.1: The R package <img src="man/figures/logo.jpg" align="right" />


<!-- badges: start -->
  [![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)
  <!-- badges: end -->


## Installation

**v3.1** is the latest and is continuously updated. It is an R package (still in development, not on CRAN) which can be installed in R by

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("manlius/muxViz")
```

## Backgroung

The R package **muxViz** enables the visualization and the analysis of interconnected multilayer networks. It supports the analysis of multilayer data:

- Multilayer correlation analysis
- Multilayer centrality analysis and annular representation
- Multilayer community structure detection
- Multilayer structural reducibility
- Multilayer motifs analysis
- Animated visualization of dynamical processes and time-varying multilayer networks

muxViz supports the analysis and visualization of the following multilayer networks:

and the following layer layouts:

### What is a multilayer network?

Multilayer networks are a class of models widely adopted to represent empirical complex system, including biomolecular networks (eg, interactomes, metabolomes), neuronal networks (eg, connectomes), information and communication networks, social/socio-technical/socio-ecological networks, economic and financial networks, urban and transportation networks.

You can read more on the dedicated [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_network) or this [short illustrated summary](theory/multilayernets.md).

#### Official Websites and Social Networks

Please, visit the official website (<http://muxviz.net>) of muxViz for further information.

You might also want to take a look at muxViz in action: see the [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCinHX7m-8_EFFJo2A8huoUA)

Visit the dedicated [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/muxviz) if you have questions or to report bugs.

Instead, if you create amazing visualizations using muxViz and you want to tweet them, remember to include the "#muxviz" hashtag: we will be happy to retweet.

You might be interested in taking a look at the [official blog about muxViz](https://muxviz.wordpress.com), with posts about applications (analysis, visualization or both) to cool datasets.

## News

Check the [release news](./NEWS.md).

## Citation

If you use muxViz (or any part of muxViz, or images available in the gallery) for your multilayer analysis and visualization, you should cite the paper

Manlio De Domenico, Mason A. Porter, Alex Arenas, Multilayer Analysis and Visualization of Networks, published in [Journal of Complex Networks 3, 159-176 (2015)](http://comnet.oxfordjournals.org/content/3/2/159) (Open Access)

Please, note that muxViz is based on some algorithms developed in other studies. You should cite the original paper(s) every time that you use those algorithms.

## The Graphical User Interface

The previous implementation exploits a Graphical User Interface (working with any browser) to provide access to many customizable graphic options to render networks.
